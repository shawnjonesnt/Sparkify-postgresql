Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

Project Description
In this project, we will be using data modeling with Postgres to build an ETL pipeline using Python. We will define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.The Star schema is the fundamental schema among the data mart schema and it is simplest. This schema is widely used to develop or build a data warehouse and dimensional data marts. It includes one or more fact tables indexing any number of dimensional tables.  It is said to be star as its physical model resembles to the star shape having a fact table at its center and the dimension tables at its peripheral representing the starâ€™s points. 
To analyze the song play data in its raw form requires to look at data in multiple files and mapping song data between logs files and the song data files. To make the analysis more efficient we should have the files loaded into database tables that are designed to answer the questions asked by analytics team. Since the analytics team is interested in knowing what songs the users are listening to and probably interested in performing ranking ,aggregation to determine which song is played the most, what is most popular song, which artist released most popular songs. Analytics may also be interested in looking at the trends over a period of time.
In order to support the required analytics a star schema design is implemented to design the data warehouse and here, Songplay table is the fact table and song, user,artist and time are dimension tables. Database integrity is maintained by using Primary key and foreign key constraints in the table definitions.
